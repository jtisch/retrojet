# retrojet

A set of perl scripts which turns a 2nd monitor into a marquee display for RetroPi & EmulationStation (ubuntu/x86 and Raspberry Pi).

The main reason I wrote these scripts was because previous tools I found required modifications to EmulationStation itself which is not necessary. These scripts run entirely using the built in events already available in EmulationStation to the end user.

The scripts were developed under Retropi x86 but they should work on a regular pi with simple config changes, feedback welcome.

## Install

First checkout to your RetroPie root folder.

`cd ~/RetroPie`
`git clone https://github.com/jtisch/retrojet --recurse`
